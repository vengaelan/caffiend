Every literate person is aware of the paragraph. Paragraphs are important in speeches, in writing or a random paragraph can be used as a prop in ads or presentations too! They are like the building blocks. Since paragraphs have so many roles to play and it is needed, websites on the internet have developed a tool called Random Paragraph Generator which is a great help for those who are in search of random paragraphs for working purposes.
In simple words, we can say that a paragraph consists of more than one sentence and the aim of a single paragraph is to carry a particular meaning. In a more formal way and depth, Merriam Webster defines a paragraph as - a subdivision of a written composition that consists of one or more sentences, deals with one point or gives the words of one speaker, and begins on a new usually indented line.
Example of a paragraph:- "Dowry consists of things given by parents to their daughters at the time of their marriage. Once this was done to start living well. But the greedy parents of bridegrooms demand more money and material. Some girls have to lose their lives by bringing fewer dowries. Burning brides is daily news these days. Both the Government and the public should discourage dowry seekers." We see how the paragraph focuses on the dowry system. Let us see what is a random Sentence Generator.
